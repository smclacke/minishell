**SARAH, SHIT TO DO AFER MICRO SHELLY, DONT FORGETTTTTTTTTT**


~~~ Lexer ~~~

-> quotes in lexer: 
	> pretty simple while loopidyloop
	> don't forget to check either side of the quotes for chars

~~~ Parser ~~~

-> when checking first token in parser if valid, <<LIMITER, <input, etc won't work cause extra shit after inside the token.... handle this!

-> quotes inside cmds, remove this before validating in the parser...
