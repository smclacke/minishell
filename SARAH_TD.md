**SARAH, SHIT TO DO AFER MICRO SHELLY, DONT FORGETTTTTTTTTT**


~~~ Lexer ~~~

-> quotes in lexer: 
	> pretty simple while loopidyloop
	> don't forget to check either side of the quotes for chars

~~~ Parser ~~~

-> when checking first token in parser if valid, <<LIMITER, <input, etc won't work cause extra shit after inside the token.... handle this!

-> quotes inside cmds, remove this before validating in the parser...


ERRORS :)





I think what i need to do now is, check the rest of the input for metas and important shit, 
give those correctly in struct form (hooooeeee???) then give it to djoyke... after shelly, 
handle all edges and the very many problems
