-----------Start with $ expanding----------

1) find out what how $USER, $Random, $ is used.
2) check for edge cases
3) do I want to put it into a struct?
4) how to pass it.

----------Make the executor expandable based on pipes--------

1) basic structure works
2) how do I want to expand it?

--------------------RANDOM-------------------------

1)Does Sarah or do I handle the passing of the quotes?
2) as soon as quotes are fixed 
    1) check exit and unset again for the quoted value etc
    2) check echo again
3) make bash script for easier testing
